// The details and Proof attached to a confidential Issuance; null if the Issuance was public
type AnalyticsConfidentialIssuanceDescription struct {
	// The commitment to both the Asset Type and amount of the issued Note
	Casset string `json:"casset,omitempty"`
	// A `Namespace` describes what Asset IDs can be issued in an Issuance Rule. It is a string in the same format as `AssetId`. Additionally, if it ends with a wildcard character `*`, then the namespace covers all asset IDs with the namespace as a prefix. Without a final wildcard, the namespace covers exactly one asset ID. Example: The namespace `currencies.dollar` covers only this exact asset type, while `currencies.*` covers all asset types that start with `currencies.`. 
	Namespace string `json:"namespace,omitempty"`
	// The Proof that the issued Asset Type indeed matches the reported Rule
	Zkproof string `json:"zkproof,omitempty"`
